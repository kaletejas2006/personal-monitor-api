Project for developing a REST API using Django for analysing cricket data

## Accessing the repository
On my work machine, accessing the repository can be tricky as this repository is created using my personal Github 
account (`tejas-kale`) whereas all my work-related repositories use my work-specific GitHub account
(`tejas-kale-relayr`). In order to perform most GitHub-related operations on this repository, I will need to 
specify my GitHub ID (`tejas-kale`) and a personal access token. This can be found in the GitHub section of my 
password manager. Examples include:

```shell
# Clone repository
git clone https://tejas-kale@github.com/tejas-kale/cricket-analysis-api.git
```
